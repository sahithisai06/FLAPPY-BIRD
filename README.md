Building this game improved my understanding of how interactive web applications work and how JavaScript can be
used beyond simple webpages to create real-time, logic-driven experiences

A browser-based Flappy Bird-inspired arcade game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The player controls a bird that must pass through moving pipes without colliding. The game demonstrates 
core front-end and game development concepts like physics simulation, collision detection, and real-time rendering.

Concepts Practiced in making this project are 
This project helped strengthen understanding of:
1. DOM Manipulation
2. Event Handling (keyboard/mouse input)
3. Game Loop Logic
4. Collision Detection Algorithms
5. Basic Physics Simulation (gravity & jump force)
6. CSS Animations & Positioning
7. Timers (setInterval / requestAnimationFrame)
